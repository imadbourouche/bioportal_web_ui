      welcome: Welcome to %{site},
    help:
      welcome: Welcome to the LifeWatch ERIC’s %{site}. %{site} is a repository of semantic resources for ecology and related domains.
      getting_started: >
        %{site} supports the community in the creation, management, mapping and alignment of its semantic resources and subsequently also of its data.
      browse: >
        Users can browse and explore individual semantic resources by navigating either a tree structure or 
        an animated graphical view. Users can also view mappings and semantic resource metadata, and download 
        semantic resources. Additionally, users who are signed in may also submit a new semantic resource to the 
        library. All submissions to the library are reviewed.

      obsolete_definition: >
        A class that the authors of the ontology have flagged as being obsolete and which they recommend that people not use. These classes 
        are often left in ontologies (rather than removing them entirely) so that existing systems that depend on them will continue to function.
